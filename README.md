# Neptro

Neptro helps people living in Nepal find housing for rent in urban areas and conversely
helps landlords find tenants. Users can access *Neptro* using an `android` application however
all work happens in the backend through web-services written in `go`.

The android app acts as a view wrapper over the go web servers.

Neptro allows users to

  1. post housing for rent
  2. search for housings for rent
  3. contact landlords

A user can create an account on neptro using their mobile phone number, which
will be verified using text.
